# Chapter 2

* We provide implementations for the simple **example NN** in different languages in [Section 2.1](./2.1/).
* We provide the code used for the **convolution** and **pooling** illustration in [Section 2.4](2.4/). We also illustrate the operation of **convolving** and **max pooling** with gifs.
