# Chapter 7

In this chapter, we provide several implementations and animations related to **unsupervised learning techniques** beyond neural networks.

  * In [Chapter 7.2](./7.2) we introduce **Voronoi diagrams** which often appear in distance-based clustering.
  * In [Chapter 7.3](./7.3) we provide the Mathematica code used to illustrate **Principal Component Analysis**
  * In [Chapter 7.4](./7.4) we provide the Python code to perform **K-Means Clustering** with Scikit learn
  * In [Chapter 7.5](./7.5) we provide a Mathematica implementation of **Mean Shift Clustering**.
  * In [Chapter 7.6](./7.6) we provide the Python code to perform **Gaussian Expectation-Maximization Clustering** with Scikit learn
  * In [Chapter 7.9](./7.9) we provide the Python code used to compare the different clustering algorithms discussed in this chapter.
