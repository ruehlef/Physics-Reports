# Comparison of clustering algorithms

We compare the different clustering algorithms introduced in Chapter 7 on dummy data in a 2D feature space of different shapes. The code for this example is essentially (up to minor modifications for the plots, the data shapes,etc.) taken from the Scikit learn homepage. To run the program execute `python plot_cluster_comparison.py` The comparison yields:
