# Chapter 8

In this chapter, we provide example implementations of **Reinforcement learning** algorithms.
  * We provide an [implementation of SARSA](./SARSA/README.md) to solve the maze introduced in Chapter 8.5 from scratch.
  * We provide an [example implementations of Deep RL](./Deep_RL/README.md), where we use the *A3C* and *DQN* implementation of ChainerRL with OpenAI gym to train agents to play *Tic Tac Toe*. The agents are trained  tabula rasa, i.e. they are only taught the rules of the game without using any other prior (human) knowledge.
