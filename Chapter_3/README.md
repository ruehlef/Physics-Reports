# Chapter 3
In this chapter we illustrate the effect of over- and undertraining, as well as different regularization techniques. Run the code with `python Undertraining_Overtraining_Regularization` or look at the Jupyter notebook [Undertraining\_Overtraining\_Regularization.ipynb](./Undertraining_Overtraining_Regularization.ipynb).

## Undertrained network
We show the original data (orange) and the result of the regressor NN (blue) for an **undertrained network**.
![Undertraining](./NN_Underfit.pdf "Undertraining.")

## Overtrained network
We show the original data (orange) and the result of the regressor NN (blue) for an **overtrained network**.
![Overtraining](./NN_Underfit.pdf "Overtraining.")

## Dropout regularization
We show the original data (orange) and the result of the regressor NN (blue); overtraining is prevented by using **dropout layers**.
![Dropout  Regularization](./NN_Underfit.pdf "Dropout  Regularization.")

## Weight regularization (L2)
We show the original data (orange) and the result of the regressor NN (blue); overtraining is prevented by using **weight regularization**.
